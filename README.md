# Agentic Workflow Orchestration Platform for AI Tasks

## Overview

Modern AI applications increasingly rely on **multi-step, stateful workflows**
involving reasoning, tool usage, and external systems. Large Language Models (LLMs)
and tools are inherently **unreliable, non-deterministic, and expensive**.

This project implements a **lightweight agentic orchestration platform** focused on:
- workflow control
- failure handling
- retries and backoff
- evaluation of AI outputs
- observability and debuggability

The goal is to treat AI systems as **distributed systems**, not model demos.

## Core Principles

1. **Models are workers, not the system**
2. **Orchestration is the control plane**
3. **Failure is expected, not exceptional**
4. **Evaluation is observability for reasoning**
5. **Every step must be inspectable and debuggable**

Frameworks are intentionally avoided in the initial implementation
to ensure a deep understanding of these principles.

## Project Roadmap

### Phase 1 — Core Orchestration (No AI)
- Sequential workflow execution
- Shared state between steps
- Structured logging

### Phase 2 — Failure Handling
- Step-level retries
- Exponential backoff
- Failure isolation

### Phase 3 — Unreliable Execution
- LLM or mock LLM worker
- Variable latency and malformed outputs

### Phase 4 — Evaluation Layer
- Output validation rules
- Quality scoring
- Retry or flag on failure

### Phase 5 — Observability
- Step latency metrics
- Retry counts
- Workflow success/failure rates

## Why This Project Matters

This project focuses on **system reliability and orchestration**, not model training.
It reflects real-world AI infrastructure challenges where correctness, debuggability,
and control are more important than raw model accuracy.
